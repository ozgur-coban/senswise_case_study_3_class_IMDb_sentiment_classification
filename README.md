# 3-Class IMDb Sentiment Classification Case Study

This repository contains the complete work for a case study on 3-class sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Mixed) using a binary-trained BERT model and NLP heuristics.

The primary objective was to build a system that could infer a "Mixed" sentiment label from IMDb reviews, given that the training data was strictly binary (Positive/Negative).

## 1. Summary & Key Results

### Method
Two `bert-base-uncased` models were trained (at 256-token and 512-token lengths) for binary classification, achieving **92%** and **93%** accuracy, respectively.

Three distinct heuristic systems were then designed to infer a 3-class label:
1.  **System 1 (Ratio):** A baseline system based on the ratio of positive/negative sentences.
2.  **System 2 (Logit):** A confidence-based system that created a "Neutral" zone for low-confidence sentences.
3.  **System 3 (Weighting):** A system that gave **2x weight** to the first and last sentences of a review, assuming they contain the main sentiment.
